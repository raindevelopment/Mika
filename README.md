# WATER isn't being developed anymore
WATER won't be developed anymore. At first WATER seemed to be a new idea and challenge and when a prototype was presented to the executive officers it was almost finished, but inside the company itself the project failed miserably.
rain will now concentrate on development of C++ headers because C++ is already an all-rounder.
